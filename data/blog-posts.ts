# Lowest Calorie Iced Drinks at Starbucks

When you're watching your calorie intake but still want to enjoy a refreshing iced drink from Starbucks, you have plenty of options. Here are the best low-calorie iced drinks that won't derail your diet.

## Top Low-Calorie Iced Options

### 1. Iced Coffee (Black)
Starting at just <b>5 calories</b> for a Tall, black iced coffee is the ultimate low-calorie option. It's refreshing, caffeinated, and completely customizable. Add a splash of your favorite milk alternative for minimal calories.

### 2. Cold Brew
Cold Brew is another excellent choice, with only <b>5 calories</b> for a Tall. This smooth, less acidic option is perfect for those who prefer a milder coffee taste. You can enjoy it black or with a small amount of milk.

### 3. Iced Caffè Americano
At just <b>10-25 calories</b> depending on size, the Iced Americano is essentially espresso shots over ice with water. It's strong, refreshing, and perfect for customization with sugar-free syrups.

### 4. Iced Tea (Unsweetened)
Starbucks offers several unsweetened iced tea options that are virtually calorie-free. The Iced Green Tea, Iced Black Tea, and Iced Passion Tango Tea all start at <b>0 calories</b> when unsweetened.

### 5. Iced Caffè Latte (with Nonfat or Almond Milk)
An Iced Latte with nonfat milk starts at around <b>100 calories</b> for a Tall. Switching to almond milk can reduce this even further to approximately <b>60 calories</b> for a Tall.

## Tips for Keeping Calories Low

1. <b>Skip the syrups</b> - Each pump of syrup adds 20-25 calories
2. <b>Choose nonfat or plant-based milks</b> - Almond milk is typically the lowest calorie option
3. <b>Avoid whipped cream</b> - This adds 70 calories
4. <b>Go sugar-free</b> - Use sugar-free syrups if you need flavor
5. <b>Order smaller sizes</b> - Tall is your best friend for calorie control

## Customization Ideas

- <b>Iced Coffee with Almond Milk</b>: ~30 calories
- <b>Cold Brew with a splash of Coconut Milk</b>: ~40 calories
- <b>Iced Americano with Sugar-Free Vanilla</b>: ~15 calories
- <b>Iced Green Tea with Lemon</b>: ~0 calories

Remember, the key to keeping your Starbucks drink low in calories is to customize it to your preferences while being mindful of add-ons. Use our calculator to see exactly how many calories your customized drink will have!
